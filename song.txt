Time has washed away and now I may wonder
How did it all slip by?
'Cause I always thought we had forever
Future calls to me to take me away from things
I don't want to leave behind
Like I'm slipping away
I can't hold on

Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home
